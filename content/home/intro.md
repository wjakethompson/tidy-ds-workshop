This workshop is designed for those who want to learn how to use R to analyze data. The material is based on Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). We'll talk about how to conduct a complete data analysis from data import to final reporting in R using a suite of packages known as the [**tidyverse**](https://tidyverse.org). The two goals of this workshop are: 1) learn how to use R to answer questions about our data; and 2) write code that is human readable and reproducible. We will also talk about how to share our code and analyses with others.

You should take this workshop if you are new to R, or to the **tidyverse**, and want to learn how to take advantage of this ecosystem to do data analysis. You'll get the most from the workshop if you are primarily interested in applying pre-existing R packages and functions your own data. We will give minimal tutorials on how to write your own functions; however, the main focus will be on using existing tools, rather than building our own.
